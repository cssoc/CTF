Some 12 year old kid got a free site that only serves static content.
He can't upgrade to a site with a backend because his parents don't allow him
to use their credit card.

He is part of an annoying group and there's a password hidden on this
website. The password is also "encoded", submit it in decoded form, it's a single word lowercase only.
