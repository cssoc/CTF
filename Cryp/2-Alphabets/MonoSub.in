All along the south coast of Cape Wrath rose crumbling stone watchtowers,
raised in ancient days to give warning of Dornish raiders stealing in across
the sea. Villages had grown up about the towers. A few had flowered into towns.
The Peregrine made port at the Weeping Town, where the corpse of the Young
Dragon had once lingered for three days on its journey home from Dorne. The
banners flapping from the town’s stout wooden walls still displayed King
Tommen’s stag-and-lion, suggesting that here at least the writ of the Iron
Throne might still hold sway. “Guard your tongues,” Arianne warned her company
as they disembarked. “It would be best if King’s Landing never knew we’d passed
this way.” Should Lord Connington’s rebellion be put down, it would go ill for
them if it was known that Dorne had sent her to treat with him and his
pretender. That was another lesson that her father had taken pains to teach
her; choose your side with care, and only if they have the chance to win.
They had no trouble buying horses, though the cost was five times what it
would have been last year. “They’re old, but sound,” claimed the hostler.
“you’ll not find better this side of Storm’s End. The griffin’s men seize
every horse and mule they come upon. Oxen too. Some will make a mark upon a
paper if you ask for payment, but there’s others who would just as soon cut
your belly open and pay you with a handful of your own guts. If you come on
any such, mind your tongues and give the horses up.”
The town was large enough to support three inns, and all their common rooms
were rife with rumors. Arianne sent her men into each of them, to hear what
they might hear. In the Broken Shield, Daemon Sand was told that the great
septry on the Holf of Men had been burned and looted by raiders from the sea,
and a hundred young novices from the motherhouse on Maiden Isle carried off
into slavery. In the Loon, Joss Hood learned that half a hundred men and boys
from the Weeping Town had set off north to join Jon Connington at Griffin’s
Roost, including young Ser Addam, old Lord Whitehead’s son and heir. But in
the aptly named Drunken Dornishman, Feathers heard men muttering that the
griffin had put Red Ronnet’s brother to death and raped his maiden sister.
Ronnet himself was said to be rushing south to avenge his brother’s death
and his sister’s dishonor.
