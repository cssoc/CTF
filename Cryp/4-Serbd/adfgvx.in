Then: Monument Plaza.
Chains rattle as they lash the neck of Emperor Palpatine. Ropes follow
suit—lassos looping around the statue’s middle. The mad cheers of the crowd as
they pull, and pull, and pull. Disappointed groans as the stone fixture refuses
to budge. But then someone whips the chains around the back ends of a couple of
heavy-gauge speeders, and then engines warble and hum to life the speeders gun
it and again the crowd pulls. The sound like a giant bone breaking.
A fracture appears at the base of the statue. More cheering. Yelling. And
applause as it comes crashing down. The head of the statue snaps off, goes
rolling and crashing into a fountain. Dark water splashes. The crowd laughs.
And then: The whooping of klaxons. Red lights strobe. Three airspeeders
swoop down from the traffic lanes above Imperial police.
Red and  black helmets. The glow of their lights reflected back in their
helmets. There comes no warning. No demand to stand down. The laser cannons at
the fore of each airspeeder open fire. Red bolts sear the air. The crowd is cut
apart. Bodies dropped and stitched with fire. But still, those gathered are not
cowed. They are no longer a crowd. Now they are a mob. They start picking up
hunks of the Palpatine statue and lobbing them up at the airspeeders. One of
the speeders swings to the side to avoid an incoming chunk of stone and it
bumps another speeder, interrupting its fire. Coruscanti citizens climb up the
stone spire behind both speeders a spire on which are written the Imperial
values of order, control, and the rule of law and begin jumping onto the
police cruisers. One helmeted cop is flung from his vehicle. The other crawls
out onto the hood of his speeder, opening fire with a pair of blasters just as
a hunk of stone cracks him in the helmet, knocking him to the ground.The other
two airspeeders lift higher and keep firing.
